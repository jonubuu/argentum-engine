/**
 * Scenario test for Preacher of the Schism (LCI #113) — {2}{B} Creature — Vampire Cleric, 2/4, Rare.
 *
 * "Deathtouch
 *  Whenever this creature attacks the player with the most life or tied for most life, create a 1/1
 *  white Vampire creature token with lifelink.
 *  Whenever this creature attacks while you have the most life or are tied for most life, you draw a
 *  card and you lose 1 life."
 *
 * Pins the new `PlayerHasMostLife` condition on both axes: the attacked player (`DefendingPlayer`,
 * resolved from the attacker's AttackingComponent) for the token trigger, and the controller (`You`)
 * for the draw trigger — including the tied case where both fire.
